# How to design your logo with AI (Stable Diffusion, Midjourney or DALLE2)

TLDR: Artificial Intelligence can be used to produce lots of visual ideas based on a brief (even if really vague). From those ideas you can select the best, combine them and create the logo of your dreams.

## A chicken wearing sunglasses

If you want to create a new logo for your company or a client, you may want to leverage Artificial Intelligence. State fo the art AI is able to produce images, lots of them, and pertinent to your vision, in a short time at a low cost. Those images the AI throws at you are not going to be the final logo. But you can iterate on them and combine them into new ideas. The final result will be outstanding, and you can get there really fast. Let's dive into an example.

Let's say I want to design a new logo for my YouTube channel (italian only). It has to be minimal, with a few colors, easily recognizable for a strong brand. The mascotte of my channel is a chicken with sunglasses called Pollo Watzlawick.

## Prompting the AI

A good logo designer starts from a brief of his client, and goes on the interwebs researching material pertinent to the brief and some other ideas floating in his head. With AI the methodology is different: the brief itself, compressed in a single sentence, will be fed as a "prompt" to an AI. The AI will do most of the visual research for the designer. In our case the prompt will be:

> # A chicken wearing sunglasses, designer logo, vector logo, award winning design, masterpiece, strong brand.

Why all those words? The prompt must be designed to push the AI in certain places (this will be the topic for another post). For now suffice to say that, starting from this sentence, the AI will generate hundreds of raw proposals in a short time. If the designer is not happy, the prompt can be changed to deepen the visual research phase.

The AI I use here is open source, is called Stable Diffusion (from now on SD). It's similar to other "hallucinating" AIs, like DALL-E2 and Midjourney.

I got 1000 (!!!) different outputs from SD. Here are some of them, a small sample displaying the variety of proposals:

Explaining this variety is also worth another post, the reason is a process called "diffusion" and some hundreds million images and short texts used in training. As you can see they are good but not excellent: the point is, this variety allows to easily pick the elements you like. Diffusion models allow us to generate an image starting both from text or another image, so we can take any of the proposals and let the AI hallucinate around it. Let's go into more detail starting from the worst.

Aberrations
Some SD proposals are out of scope, some nightmarish, some just gibberish. In the following samples there is no chicken at all. The first in particular seems to be related to nothing in particular, while still visually pleasant.







Let's move to some interesting takes on the concepts of "chicken" and "sunglasses". From left to right: siamese chickens using one pair of sunglasses, a guy preferring a chickentail to a ponytail, sunglasses as a bra, some kind of pamphlet.






Some of the proposals, while not even close to what we want, are quite enjoyable and can be the best source for lateral thinking, bringing to new iterations and ideas. Note the "design" writing in the first one below. We will talk about the text into images later in the post.






## Main subject

A vector logo is an exercise in minimalism. Here is how an AI can simplify yet render clear that the protagonist of the brand is a chicken:







Speaking about simplifying, I fell deeply in love with the sunglasses of this proposal. They are unapologetically borderline. Would you say they were sunglasses if you didn't know it beforehand?





Sure, one can simplify to the point of exaggerating,



or add too many details like 1. reflection on sunglasses, 2. chickens inside the reflection on sunglasses, 3. a full blown sunset-sky-over-an-institutional-building reflection on sunglasses.




## Colors

Somebody will write a book called "artificial color theory". Maybe GPT-3 itself. Please enjoy SD's mastery in dealing with 1. black and white, 2. small palette, 3. gradients and 4. shades of gray.





Stable Diffusion can be delicate with colors, using a palette coherent with the subject at hand, academically respecting the color wheel. It can go a little more creative, adding deviant colors or go in the other direction, simplifying while adding contrast. It can go full psychedelic. If you are a designer and still a non-believer while seeing this, I would be surprised.




## Background
F
lat backgound, gradient, transparency, and even gestalt theory awareness.




Let us zoom on the last one. For the first time in my life I believe Kurzweil may be right.






And since AI is based on pattern recognition, we expected and found pattern generation:





And now, let SD teach us how to use stripes to add drama.






Sometimes the proposal is embedded in the physical world, as a preview of its use. We can print the logo and observe it on a table (note the shadow), we can just keep it in our hand, take it out from under a book or admiring it on a laptop.

## Text and fonts

Lots of images contain literal text from the prompt: you can easily read "chicken" and "design". Sometimes words are mispelled, sometimes there are other words, featuring letters from other alphabets or never seen before. Sometimes visual and texts are heavily melted. Also noteworthy are the variety of fonts and the overall compositions.

## Conclusion
Prompt, selection, a few iterations, and final logo. I didn't finalize a logo yet, because I'm having too much fun. Since my freelance activity is in 



TODO: why is this better than google? add to the prompt "artificial intelligence"
