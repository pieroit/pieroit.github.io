There are 3 reason why italians ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ will be leaders in AI and automation:

1. We don't like to work
2. We thrive in messyness
3. We create as an habit

Never underestimate what lazy creative people would do in order to work less. And if the results are suboptimal, who cares: time for dancing and loving.

Work in a capitalistic society is just a politically correct version of slavery.
It has to end in favour of spending our life the way we want, without the constant threath of getting poor and homeless. Let machines do the work.

I can't imagine any amount of money giving you back time, which is the real currency here. You get one life, there's no paradise.

The transition may be violent, as the elites are not going to allow universal basic income or any form of due social welfare. But the Gini index is growing everywhere, automation-driven job displacement is real and the family unit is basically destroyed. Everything has turned in a damn subscription in a sea of loneliness. We spend out time working on a black mirror and make no children.

You can expect many to choose rebellion over submission. Heroism is born out of desperation, and courage out of finally accepting fear.
Tension has to be released. History gifted us of many such examples.

The necessary key is to get community ownership of the infrastructure, at any cost. Hyperscalers are set to develop what many call "rent capitalism", a new feudalistic and technocratic order. They want to rip the benefits of a 100x productivity, and they're too greedy to redistribute value.

Am I not ashamed of engaging in Marxist thinking on LinkedIn?
No, I just don't care because nobody can fire me. Marx was right all along.
You instead should be ashamed when you idolize Steve Jobs or Elon Musk.

Work for survival is a disgusting concept and a cruel conditioning.
Don't fall for the american dream. That's a mathematically proven false hope. Yapping about "peace and democracy" while doing the exact opposite, bombing countries and overthrowing governments. The rich and powerful sees us either as an asset or as a liability, in both cases not as human beings.

Mark my words, italians are going to be leaders in a new alternative. The whole south of the world is coming and rightfully so.

LET MACHINES DO THE WORK
